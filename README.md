Student Attendance System

This project is a Django-based student attendance system that provides three panels: one for students, one for teachers, and one for administrators.
Teacher Panel

Teachers can log in to view a list of lectures they need to deliver on a particular day, with additional information such as lecture timing and room number. The current lecture is highlighted.

By clicking on a particular lecture, teachers can see a list of students enrolled in that course. Teachers can then mark each student as present or absent. There is also a search bar to search for a student by name. After marking attendance, teachers can submit the attendance record.
Student Panel

Students need to log in first. After logging in, they will see a list of all subjects along with additional information such as the total number of lectures, the number of lectures attended, the number of absences, and the attendance percentage. The name of the teacher for each subject is also displayed.

When a student clicks on a particular subject, they will get a detailed attendance record, including a list of dates and whether the student was present or absent on each date.
Admin Panel

The admin panel allows the administrator to manage the following:

    Department information
    Teacher information
    Lecture information, including which teacher will teach which subject to which course, and the timing of the lectures
    Student information
    Courses
